# racktables-propel

playbook to auto-add your server info on racktables


## requirements

The script created using ruby 1.9 and some common gems like facter, (any)yamlparser, logger so minimal requirements

## supported system

tested and run on Ubuntu 12.04 32 & 64bit. patch for other server soon

## dependencies

The script is design to use the Racktables-api forked and release by [ibettinger](https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables) 

also checkout his workaround on [racktables-py-client](https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables-py-client) - a very cool stuff, I use as a reference

note: tested on Racktables ver 0.20.3 & 0.20.6
