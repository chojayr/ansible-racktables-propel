# racktables-propel

playbook to auto-add your server info on racktables


## requirements

The script created using ruby 1.9 and some common gems like facter, (any)yamlparser, logger so minimal requirements

## supporter system

tested and run on Ubuntu 12.04 32 & 64bit. patch for other server soon

## dependencies

The scrip is design to use the Rackbtales-api forked and release by [ibettinger](https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables) 

also checkout his workaround on [racktables-py-client](https://github.com/ibettinger/racktables-py-client) - a very cool stuff, I use as a reference
